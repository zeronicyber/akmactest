Anaconda have proposed $100 and $7000 per person annually for Python package and Anaconda support respectively. Client have decided not to opt in Anaconda because this cost may go up in the future if we are dependent on their repository. Python installer is one of the alternatives, It offers various tools like VENV, VirtualENV, Poetry but it is lacking few key features. 

Venv/Virtualenv creates project-specific, local environments usually in a . venv/ folder per project. In contrast, conda 's environments are global and saved in one place. PyPI works with both tools through pip , but conda can add additional channels, which can sometimes install faster. conda is more robust than venv or pip, can be combined with pip, and is probably the better default option. 

Conda environments can set up environments for (multiple ) python and also R, so if you switch between the two conda is probably preferable so you only need to learn one set of tools/conventions. 
Conda environments all get stored in a single folder and remote location.  
Pro: you can easily look up all environments you've created.
Pro: you can re-use one environment for multiple projects  


Conda is both an environments manager as well as a package manager like PIP. Useful comparison table here.

We are looking for solution to support python packages thru conda way preferably but other recommendations are welcome too; Miniforge/conda-forge is closest solution at the moment. Client would like to know if cognizant has any solution to handle python packages or anaconda efficiently. It would be great if we have similar implementation in any of our other engagement(s).
