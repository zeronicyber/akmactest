Subject: Upcoming SAS 9.4 Upgrade Plan

Dear Team,

I hope this email finds you well. I wanted to inform you about the upcoming SAS 9.4 upgrade scheduled for implementation. Below is the plan outline along with specific tasks and actions to be taken:

1. **Communication Email about Change Scheduled:**
   - An official communication email will be sent out to all stakeholders to notify them about the scheduled change and its implications.

2. **Production Backup:**
   - Ensure the backup of SYSPSAS physical files on HTF-1/2 using ZFS. No changes are required in the backup process.

3. **Create JCL:**
   - JCL1: Copy SYSTSAS to SYSTSAS.prod
     - Example: SYSTSAS.HTF1.BAMISC to SYSTSAS.HTF1.prod.BAMISC
   - JCL2: Rename SYSTSAS.prod to SYSPSAS
     - Example: SYSTSAS.HTF1.PROD.BAMISC to SYSPSAS.HTF1.BAMISC
   - Delete Alias: DEL SYSPSAS
   - Define Alias: ALIAS SYSPSAS

4. **ZFS File Creations Based on SYSTSAS:**
   - Run the JCL to create ZFS files based on SYSTSAS.

On the date of implementation:
   - Run the JCL in the specified order.
   - MOSE: Set mount points accordingly.

Please review the plan and let me know if you have any questions or concerns. Your cooperation and support are crucial for the success of this upgrade.
